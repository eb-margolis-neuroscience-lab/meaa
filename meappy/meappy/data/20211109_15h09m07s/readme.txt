These test package data files are based on the actual data from slice session 20211109_15h09m07s.

To see the entire units_ts.tsv file, it can be created with code from phy_2_nwb.py and the raw PHY 
data in the data/modat.GUI directory. See jupyter notebook compare_phy_nwb.ipynb for 
example.

The PHY data in the data/modat.GUI directory is from an export created by Elyssa on Oct 2, 2022. The Spyking Circus parameters file [20211109_15h09m07s.modat.params] can be used to recreate the PHY directory output.
