\title{meapr: Multi-Electrode Array Pharmacology in R}
\description{
The \link{meapr} R package is part of the \strong{meap}, a multi-language framework for
the pharmacology analysis of \emph{Multi-Electrode Array Experiments}. A
multi-electrode array experiment consists of placing a sample such as a brain
slice on an array of electrodes which can detect individual firing events
(spikes) based on the change in electrical potential at one or more
electrodes (e.g. for the MED64 platform there are 8x8 electrodes arranged in
a grid). Electrical traces can be recorded for up to several hours with
millisecond timing precision. The sample can be manipulated by, for example,
applying drugs or other treatments directly. In a typical experiment, after
recordings from a sample has begun, it is equilibrated to form a baseline
for e.g. 5-10 minutes, then a series of treatments are applied and the
transient and stationary effects of the treatment are observed over
e.g. 5-10 minutes each.

To process these data, the electrode traces are sorted into discrete firing
events and then clustered across electrodes into units which represent
individual neurons. The central pharmacology question is to understand how
the treatments cause the observed patterns in firing event time series.

Here are some considerations
\itemize{
\item Each firing event has the associated \strong{waveform} with e.g. an amplitude
and duration.
\item The firing patterns for neuron in each treatment can be transient or
stationary. For \emph{stationary} behavior, \emph{firing rate} and \emph{dispersion}
capture the overall activity of each neuron, while the
\emph{temporal auto-correlation} gives the fine structure firing patterns over
different timescales. For example, at short timescales, common pattern to
see are (1) a refactory period after each firing event, (2) regular tonic
firing a preferred frequency, and (3) burst firing with intervals of high
and low firing rates.
\item \strong{Transient} firing patterns after a treatment has been applied include
rapid changes in firing patterns that decay into stationary behavior.
\item Neuronal response to treatments can be \strong{non-exchangeable} if the
responses depend on the order in which they are applied. For example, if
a treatment has acute toxicity, or desensitization, later treatments may
fail to evoke typical responses. To observe and characterize these
diverse treatment effects
\item Within a sample there may be \strong{neuronal heterogeneity}, where different
neurons and may have different firing patterns and responses to
treatments.
\item Samples may have \strong{batch effects} that can that depend on source animal,
the treatment batch, the recording session, and the experimental
apparatus, and experimenter.
}

The core capabilities of \link{meapr} are to
\itemize{
\item \strong{Load sorted spikes} from from programs such as SpyKING Circus that
take raw electrical traces and produce sparse firing event data
\item \strong{Quality control} for multi-electrode array experimental data
including checking the quality of neurons and stability baselines.
\item \strong{Estimate firing patterns} of neurons across treatments and
experiments.
