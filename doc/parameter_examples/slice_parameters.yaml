    notes:  'This notes section of the slice_parameter.yaml file will be 
        overwritten by notes from the experiment.xls file.  [In contrast the
        `description` field in the protocol_parameter.yaml file will not be
        overwritten.

        Use this for notes on specific slice run. Because this 
        description is in quotes, YAML can read it as a single long block of 
        wrapped text, even though it is multiple lines in YAML file. 

        Adding an extra blank line inside the same block text quote will be 
        read by YAML as a new line.

        Attempting to add lists, or other complex grammatical structures into 
        this kind of text block will sometimes be less readable than creating 
        an actual structured list as data in YAML'
