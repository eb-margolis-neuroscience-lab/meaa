# protocol_parameters.yaml

# Protocol Parameters file format version 0.2
# This is a draft YAML file for data from multiple slice runs
# that all use a similar experimental treatment protocol.
# Subject to changes as needed

    description: 'This `description` field in the protocol_parameter.yaml 
        file will not be overwritten. [In contrast the `notes` section of 
        the slice_parameter.yaml file will be overwritten by notes from 
        the experiment.xls file.]

        This description is in quotes, therefore YAML can read it as a single 
        long block of wrapped text, even though it is multiple lines in YAML file. 

        Adding an extra blank line inside the same block text quote will be 
        read by YAML as a new line.

        Attempting to add lists, or other complex grammatical structures into 
        this kind of text block will sometimes be less readable than creating 
        an actual structured list as data in YAML'
