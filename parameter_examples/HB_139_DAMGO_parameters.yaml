   description: 'Apply DAMGO and other treatments. Because this 
   description is in quotes, YAML can read it as a single long block of 
   wrapped text, even though it is multiple lines in YAML file. 

   Adding an extra blank line inside the same block text quote will be 
   read by YAML as a new line.

   Attempting to add lists, or other complex grammatical structures into 
   this kind of text block will sometimes be less readable than creating 
   an actual structured list as data in YAML'
