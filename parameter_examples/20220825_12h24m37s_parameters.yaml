    notes:  'Use this for notes on specific slice run. Because this 
       description is in quotes, YAML can read it as a single long block of 
       wrapped text, even though it is multiple lines in YAML file. 

       Adding an extra blank line inside the same block text quote will be 
       read by YAML as a new line.

       Attempting to add lists, or other complex grammatical structures into 
       this kind of text block will sometimes be less readable than creating 
       an actual structured list as data in YAML'
